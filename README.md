## Domain of interest:

We chose to focus on the music industry, combining it with the domains of movies and social media. This decision was based on the large amount of public open data related to these areas and we thought it would be interesting to find links between them.

## Objective

The objective of this repository is to propose an ontology that can handle data about music. The proposed system aims to model:

- General information about MusicEntity (single Artist or Group) and its discography
- Information about user-generated Playlist
- Information about Movies in which an Artist has taken part
